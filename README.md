# Market-Basket,Customer-RFM-Churn-Analysis-SQL-PYTHON-POWERBI-

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and market dynamics using a multi-tool approach, integrating SQL for data structuring, Python for advanced analytics (Clustering, Churn Prediction, Market Basket Analysis), and Power BI for interactive data visualization and reporting, specifically focusing on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

The primary goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence to enable targeted marketing campaigns, optimize inventory, and improve customer retention strategies.

## RFM Analysis	Power BI (DAX)]
*Segmented customers based on their purchasing habits (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to identify High-Value, At-Risk, and Loyal segments.

## K-Means Clustering	Python (Scikit-learn)
* Performed unsupervised machine learning to derive data-driven customer segments, validating and expanding upon RFM groups.

## Market Basket Analysis (MBA)	Python (Apriori Algorithm)	
*Discovered strong associations between products using metrics like Support, Confidence, and Lift to inform cross-selling and bundling strategies.

## Customer Churn Prediction	Python (Machine Learning)	
* Developed a classification model to identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention efforts.
* Data Modeling	SQL, Power BI	Structured transactional data into a Star Schema model for efficient analysis and accurate metric calculation.

# Key Outcomes and Business Impact


* Market Basket Analysis findings provide direct recommendations for product placement, cross-promotions, and creating compelling product bundles based on high association rules. This directly increases the Average Order Value (AOV).

* Identified High-Value Customers: RFM analysis and K-Means clustering successfully isolated the most loyal and profitable customer segments, informing strategies for premium services and exclusive offers.

* Improved Retention: The Churn Prediction model allows the business to target "At-Risk" customers with specific retention campaigns before they leave.

* Data-Driven Channel Strategy: Analysis of profit and repeat purchases by category and vendor (restaurant_id) highlighted the most successful business channels to focus future investment on.
